## Planti
Planti is an alien learning English with kids through playing word game. It arrives on earth in a pot with a fan and several lights on her head to communicate with human beings. While she does make sound when her lips move, that’s not enough to understand each other. So she is using an app on smartphone as a translator for her to communicate with humans. She could learn vocabulary through playing word game with kids. With her vocabulary level grow, more word games unlock.
