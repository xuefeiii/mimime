## Planti
Planti is an alien learning English with kids through playing word game. It arrives on earth in a pot with a fan and several lights on her head to communicate with human beings. While she does make sound when her lips move, thatâ€™s not enough to understand each other. So she is using an app on smartphone as a translator for her to communicate with humans. She could learn vocabulary through playing word game with kids. With her vocabulary level grow, more word games unlock.
